# X96Q-H313-Experiments
Workaround the X96Q Android STB

## Departure ðŸ›«

Well, let's start where it all began!  
I've been considering reducing my office's power consumption for several months now.

While browsing "Le bon coin" on 13-08-2024, I came across some Android-based Set-Top-Boxes for around ten euros.  
The one I selected is an X96Q built around an AllWinner H313 SOC with 2Gb RAM and 16GB ROM.

This repo lists all the steps I've taken to get to grips with the device.
